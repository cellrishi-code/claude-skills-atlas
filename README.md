## What is Claude Skills Atlas?

**Claude Skills Atlas** is an open-source, community-maintained library of reusable instructions and agent resources.

It organizes practical AI building blocks that would otherwise remain scattered across personal notes, chats, repositories, and bookmarks into a structured, searchable collection.

The Atlas currently covers:

- **Skills** — reusable instruction packages for repeatable tasks
- **Prompts** — focused, copy-paste-ready prompts
- **Workflows** — multi-step procedures for agent-assisted work
- **Agents** — specialized agent definitions
- **Templates** — starting points for creating new resources
- **Plugins & integrations** — ways to consume Atlas resources from AI-agent environments

The project is designed to be useful for **developers, researchers, students, engineers, educators, and AI practitioners**.

> **Vision:** build a high-quality, community-driven ecosystem of reusable AI resources that can work across modern agent platforms.

---

## Why this project?

AI agents become significantly more useful when good instructions, workflows, and reusable context can be shared rather than recreated from scratch.

Claude Skills Atlas provides a structured place to:

1. **Discover** a reusable resource.
2. **Adapt** it to your use case.
3. **Test** it in a real workflow.
4. **Improve** it through an open-source contribution.
5. **Share** the improved version with the community.

This turns the repository into a continuously improving **AI resource ecosystem**, rather than a static prompt collection.

## Quick start

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cellrishi-code/claude-skills-atlas.git
cd claude-skills-atlas
```

### Validate locally

The repository includes lightweight validation for resource structure, skill metadata, required skill sections, duplicate resource names, and broken internal Markdown links.

```bash
python scripts/validate_atlas.py
python -m unittest discover tests
```

A pull request that changes Atlas resources or validation tooling is checked automatically by GitHub Actions.

### Try a resource

- [Code Review Skill](skills/coding/code-review/SKILL.md)
- [Implementation Planner](skills/coding/implementation-planner/SKILL.md)
- [Evidence Checker](skills/research/evidence-checker/SKILL.md)

- [Active Learning Prompt](prompts/learning/active-learning.md)

Open a resource, understand its intended use, adapt it to your context, and test it.

## Agent ecosystem & integrations

The Atlas is evolving beyond a repository of Markdown files. It is being structured as a reusable resource layer for modern AI-agent workflows.

### Claude Code

The repository includes Claude Code plugins and skills for consuming Atlas resources.

```text
/plugin marketplace add cellrishi-code/claude-skills-atlas
/plugin install claude-skills-atlas@claude-skills-atlas
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for setup instructions.

### ChatGPT integration

A read-only **ChatGPT-compatible API/plugin scaffold** is available under [`plugins/chatgpt-atlas/`](plugins/chatgpt-atlas/).

It provides:

- Resource discovery
- Keyword search
- Resource retrieval
- OpenAPI 3 specification
- A lightweight Node.js reference server
- Explicit read-only and untrusted-content boundaries

> **Deployment note:** the ChatGPT integration is a self-hosted integration scaffold. Deploy the API behind HTTPS and configure the OpenAPI server URL before connecting it to an external agent environment.

### Codex and additional agent integrations

Support for **Codex and additional AI-agent integrations is planned**. The goal is to make the same community resources portable across multiple agent environments without duplicating the underlying knowledge.

---

## Atlas architecture

The Atlas follows a simple community feedback loop:

```mermaid
graph LR
    User[User] --> Discover[Discover]
    Discover --> Resource[Skill / Prompt / Workflow / Agent]
    Resource --> Use[Use & Adapt]
    Use --> Feedback[Feedback]
    Feedback --> PR[Pull Request]
    PR --> Review[Review]
    Review --> Merge[Merge]
    Merge --> Library[(Atlas)]
    Library --> Discover
```

Resources improve through real-world use, testing, review, and contribution.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and [docs/diagrams.md](docs/diagrams.md).

---

## What makes a good resource?

A high-quality Atlas resource should be:

- **Purposeful** — solves a real, repeatable problem
- **Clear** — understandable without private context
- **Reusable** — avoids unnecessary hard-coded assumptions
- **Testable** — has a practical way to verify behavior
- **Honest** — states limitations and uncertainty
- **Safe** — avoids secrets, malicious payloads, and unsafe defaults
- **Maintainable** — follows the repository's structure and naming conventions
- **Attributed** — respects licenses and original creators

For skills, a strong `SKILL.md` normally explains:

1. Purpose
2. When to use it
3. Inputs and context
4. Procedure
5. Constraints
6. Expected output
7. Verification or quality checks

See the [Skill Template](templates/skill-template.md).

## How the Atlas is maintained

Resources are reviewed for usefulness, clarity, duplication, safety, attribution, and maintainability. Generated files such as `CATALOG.md` should be updated through the repository tooling rather than edited manually.

For agent-facing consumers, prefer stable repository paths and documented resource formats. Treat Atlas resources as community content: inspect and adapt them before granting an agent access to tools, files, credentials, or external systems.

## Roadmap

The project is actively evolving toward a broader **AI-agent resource ecosystem**.

Planned and ongoing areas include:

- More high-quality skills and prompts
- Automated resource validation
- Better search and machine-readable metadata
- Duplicate-resource detection
- Contributor tooling
- Security and quality checks
- ChatGPT and other agent integrations
- Codex integration
- Improved plugin distribution
- Community-driven domain expansion

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and the [open issues](https://github.com/cellrishi-code/claude-skills-atlas/issues) for current work.

## 🌟 Help grow the community

Claude Skills Atlas becomes more valuable as more people contribute their knowledge, experiments, tools, and ideas. You can help even without writing code: **documentation, testing, issue reports, reviews, examples, and domain knowledge all count.**

If you contribute, consider becoming a regular contributor and helping newcomers make their first PR. The goal is not just a large repository — it is a welcoming community that continuously improves shared AI resources.

## Support the project

If you find the Atlas useful:

**⭐ Star the repository** · **🍴 Fork it** · **🛠️ Add a resource** · **💬 Open an issue** · **🔀 Submit a PR** · **Share it**
